**🐺 HELLO WORLD**

<!-- I live in Slovenia (EU). I grew up with early personal computers and beginnings of the Internet. I then somehow stumbled into being close but still far from Web 2.0 evolution. When crypto / distributed systems revolution slowly started getting traction I managed to be closer to everything than ever before. I am still an outsider of course. Tech and scientific arenas are vast and I feel insignificant. I still play with some things though. I figured out where I can make useful contributions and so I do it, step by step, slowly, ε > 0.
