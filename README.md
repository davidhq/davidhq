**🐺 HELLO WORLD**

I live in Slovenia (EU). I grew up with early personal computers and beginnings of the Internet. I then somehow stumbled into being close but still far from Web 2.0 evolution. When crypto / distributed systems revolution slowly started getting traction I managed to be closer to everything than ever before. I am still an outsider of course. Tech and scientific arenas are vast and I feel insignificant. I still play with some things though. I figured out where I can make useful contributions and so I do it, step by step, slowly, ε > 0.

<!-- Currently just trying to build life-changing distributed apps on my own terms and with great care for usefulness and sustainability. Great software must justify physical energy and human attention it is consuming. It has to be net positive for the world to survive or it becomes history too soon. -->

<!-- I am sometimes told I have psychological issues. This is true but incomplete. I have many other issues as well. I also love GitHub issues, I am always fixing them. Keep 'em coming. I sometimes fix other peoples' issues as well. Problems are source of life. Fix it Felix! If you read this source. YO!!! -->
